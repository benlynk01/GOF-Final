    <h2>Tech before the attacks</h2>
    <h3>Technology was much different before these ruthless attacks.</h3>
    <h3>There were no boarding passes, no ID, and shoes were left on. Security was made to be invisible and to be in the background instead of everywhere the passengers looked. People were able to arrive at the airport last minute and not have to worry about missing their flight due to TSA.</h3>
    <h3>No one questioned who you were or if you had any troubled past like it is now.</h3>

    <h3>All of these past rules and regulations, or lack there of, is what caused these terrorists to easily hijack the planes.</h3>
    <h3>There were no metal detectors or security checks. The lack of security and safety in airports from back then is extremely shocking to someone who has been raised with airports that have a very high security detail.</h3>
