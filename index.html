    <h2>What happened on September 11, 2001?</h2>
    <h3>As all know, 9/11 was a tragic day. A group of Al-Qaeda terrorists coordinated a series of attacks on American soil. They hijacked planes and dove the planes into important cites in the U.S. </h3>
    <h3>The targets were the World Trade Center, The Pentagon, and the U.S. Capitol or the White House. Luckily the plane that was targeting the Capitol or the White House was taken over by passengers and crashed near Shanksville, Pennsylvania.</h3>
    <h3>Unfortunately the rest of the planes completed their missions and destroyed both towers of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon took a massive strike.</h3>
