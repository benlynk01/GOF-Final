    <h2>Technology in the current state</h2>
    <h3>In June 2017 facial recognition and biometric screening were replacing boarding passes. This is a collaboration of Delta Air Lines and TSA. The system takes a photo of the passenger and matches it with the one on the airline's file.</h3>
    <h3>This raised a significant privacy concern to many people though. People fear that the government would be able to track where a person is going anytime they board a flight.</h3>
    <h3>TSA tried to expand this new and efficient technology, but the project was delayed due to Covid-19</h3>
    <h3>In 2021 TSA has kept building their security. The agency has over 65,000 employees and spends billions of dollars in efforts to keep people safe.</h3>

    <h3>TSA has also implemented air cargo screening, which checks 100% of luggage packed onto the plane. Before I only discussed carry-on items, such as backpacks, purses, and smaller bags.</h3>
    <h3>TSA also uses millimeter wave advanced imaging technology to safely screen passengers for metallic and nonmetallic threats, including weapons and explosives.</h3>
